## Test

### Options

 - pyTest
 
## Integration

### Options

 - TravisCI: recommended for OpenSource and OS small projects. However, it runs on the cloud and it is not fully configurable. 
 - Jenkins: in case the project starts to grow a lot.

## Deployment

### Options

 - Ansible: because I want to play with it.

## Orchestration

### Options

- Kubernetes: let's try Docker with Kubernetes.
